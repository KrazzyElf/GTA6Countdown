# GTA6Countdown

![Learning In Public](https://img.shields.io/badge/learning-in%20public-blueviolet)

Hey there! 👋

This is a simple countdown app for GTA 6’s release, made by me (**KrazzyElf**) as a learning project. I’m new to coding and built this with a lot of help from AI and online resources. I wanted to share my progress, learn from others, and maybe help someone else who’s just starting out too.

**What does it do?**
- Shows a live countdown to GTA 6’s release date
- Has a stylish, Vice City-inspired look
- Lets you switch between a full and simple view
- Always stays on top (or not, if you want)
- That’s it! Just a fun little project

**Why is this public?**
I believe in learning in public—even if my code isn’t perfect, I want to get better and help others who are also learning. If you have tips, feedback, or just want to say hi, please do!

**Windows SmartScreen warning?**
If you see a “Windows protected your PC” message, that’s totally normal. Just click **More info** and **Run anyway.**
If you’re curious or cautious, feel free to look through the code—transparency is important to me!
